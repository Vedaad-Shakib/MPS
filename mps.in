Format:
1: radius of influence
2: spacing between points
3: number of wall segments (nWallSegments)
4-4+nWallSegments-1: list of wall segment boundaries
4+nWallSegments-1: number of fluid boundaries
4+nWallSegments+nFluidSegments-2: list of fluid segment boundaries


Note: ghost points (walls) are calculated on the left side of the wall segment vector and
      fluid points are calculated on the left side of the fluid segment vector
