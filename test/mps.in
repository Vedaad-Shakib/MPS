Format:
1: radius of influence
2: spacing between points
3: delta t
4: density of fluid
5: number of wall segments (nWallSegments)
6: list of wall segment boundaries
7: number of fluid boundaries
8: list of fluid segment boundaries
9: starting point for floodfill (boundary must be closed)

Note: ghost points (walls) are calculated on the left side of the wall segment vector and
      fluid points are calculated on the left side of the fluid segment vector
