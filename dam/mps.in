Format:
1: radius of influence
2: spacing between points
3: delta t
4: density of fluid
5: viscosity of fluid
6: beta constant for calculation of free surface points
   if densityNumber_i <= beta*averageDensityNumber, i is free surface
7: number of timesteps the simulation runs for
8: number of wall segments (nWallSegments)
9: list of wall segment boundaries
10: number of fluid boundaries
11: list of fluid segment boundaries
12: starting point for floodfill (boundary must be closed)

Note: ghost points (walls) are calculated on the left side of the wall segment vector and
      fluid points are calculated on the left side of the fluid segment vector
